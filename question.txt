Objective:

Create a Streamlit Python program that analyzes a given text, demonstrating your understanding of data types, operators, keywords, string casting, and string methods.
This assignment is provided by Sir Hamza for this week.

Assignment Instructions

1. User Input:

- Use Streamlit to take a paragraph as input from the user.
- Ensure the input is a string and validate that the user does not submit an empty input.

2. Text Analysis Features:

1. Word and Character Count:
- Calculate and display the total number of words in the paragraph.
- Count and display the total number of characters (including spaces).

2. Vowel Count:
- Count and display the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the text.

3. Search and Replace:
- Create input fields for the user to:
- Enter a word they want to search for in the paragraph.
- Enter another word to replace it with.
- Display the modified paragraph after replacement.

4. Uppercase and Lowercase Conversion:
- Display the paragraph converted entirely to uppercase.
- Display the paragraph converted entirely to lowercase.

3. Type Casting:

- Convert the word count and vowel count into strings.
- Use formatted strings to display the results clearly in Streamlit.

4. Operators:

- Use comparison operators to check if the paragraph contains the word "Python".
- Use arithmetic operators to calculate the average word length (total characters / total words).

5. Python Keywords:

- Use at least one if statement to check for a condition (e.g., check if the word "Python" is in the text).
